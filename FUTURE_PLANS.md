# Future AI Integration and Symptom Diagnosis

While this Hospital Management System currently handles ward management, patient admission, doctor assignment, and appointment booking, future enhancements aim to integrate AI-driven features to improve healthcare outcomes, including:

- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis:** Implementing a symptom checker that helps patients identify possible illnesses using AI models trained on medical data. This would assist doctors in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

- **Personalized Patient Care:** Using machine learning algorithms to analyze patient history and suggest personalized treatment plans, improving efficiency and outcomes.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Leveraging AI to predict patient admission trends, resource requirements, and potential outbreaks, enabling proactive hospital management.
